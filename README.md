 This website will allow the students to decide between suggested schedules for their registration needs instead of having to decide on what to take or worry if they skim over the curriculum sheet and miss a class they needed. The student will input their log in (or sign up to create a new account) and view their homepage with their account settings placed upon account creation. After successfully logging in, students are able to view several different suggested schedules. These classes are algorithmically chosen to not overlap, or cause issues based on when the classes are offered each semester. Additionally, they will be able to rate their previous courses based on their workload difficulty. While this wonâ€™t benefit them directly, future students taking that specific course will be able to clearly understand how difficult it is in order to avoid overloading their schedule. For ease of access, special dates including registration times and dates, holiday breaks, and major campus events will be shown to allow students to easily see important information without having to navigate between different websites. The overall goal of the website is to aid students in the registration process.
